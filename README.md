## Hi there, I'm Frank ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm a computer science and physics major at the University of Florida. I love learning about the new technologies that come out especially with the new technology of quantum computing and I love learning about the absolute beautiful application of AI and it's limits in research. I also love studying the fundamental laws that control the universe we live in which is, physics! Outside of my academia, I am an avid gym goer and I love to learn how to cook, paint, and other artistic disciplines.

As of current I am working on artificial intelligence (large language models and computer vision), computational physics, DSA, and Full Stack web development.
